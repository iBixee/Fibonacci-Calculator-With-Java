# Fibonacci-Calculator-with-Java

The Java program provided calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the previous two numbers.

Here's how the program works:

1. The main method is the entry point of the program. In this method, you can specify the number of Fibonacci terms you want to calculate by changing the value of the n variable.
2. The program then prints a message to indicate that it will display the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
3. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to n - 1 to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence terms. It does this by calling the fibonacci method for each index i.
4. The fibonacci method is a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci number at position n. If n is 0 or 1, the method returns n because these are the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the Fibonacci numbers by summing the results of two previous calls: fibonacci(n - 1) and fibonacci(n - 2).

For example, if you set n to 10, the program will calculate and print the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

You can modify the value of n in the main method to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a different number of terms, as needed.
